     <h1>How to Make Guacamole Step-by-Step</h1>
     <p>We'll be using Classic Guacamole recipe as a guide,
          but you can always add or subtract ingredients 
          based on your tastes (keep reading for more twists on classic guac)</p>

          <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh serrano chili</li>
              <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided</li>
              <li>¼ cup finely diced white onion</li>
              <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt for grinding vegetables, plus more to taste</li>
              <li>4 large Hass avocados</li>
              <li>1 cup diced ripe tomatoes, drained (Optional)</li>
              <li>1 lime, juiced, or more to taste</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Steps:</h3>
          <ol>
              <li>Place minced peppers, 1/4 cup of the chopped cilantro, 
                  and the diced onions on a cutting board.</li>
              <li>Chop them together into very small pieces. </li>
              <li>Sprinkle with kosher salt. Using the flat side of the knife blade, 
                        smear the mixture to work it into a paste, and chop again to achieve as fine a 
                        texture as possible.</li>
              <li>Stem, halve, and pit the avocados. Scoop out flesh and place in a bowl.</li>
              <li>Add 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, onion and serrano mixture, 
                  salt, and fresh lime juice. Mash with a potato masher 
                  to desired texture (smooth or chunky), five or six minutes.</li>
              <li>Taste and adjust seasonings. If not serving immediately, 
                  cover and refrigerate.</li>
          </ol>
